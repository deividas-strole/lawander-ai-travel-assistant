# LaWander — AI Travel Itinerary Generator by Deividas Strole

LaWander is an AI-powered travel itinerary generator built with Java, Spring Boot, React, JavaScript, and PostgreSQL. Developed by Deividas Strole, this full-stack application helps users create personalized travel plans by simply entering a destination and trip duration. The AI generates a detailed day-by-day itinerary and displays points of interest on an interactive map.

This project, created by Deividas Strole, showcases modern full-stack development, AI integration, database management, and interactive frontend features — perfect for anyone interested in travel tech or building intelligent web applications.

🚀 Overview

LaWander simplifies trip planning with artificial intelligence. Users input their destination (e.g., "Tokyo, Japan") and the length of their stay (e.g., "7 days"), and the app returns a tailored itinerary complete with activities, sights, and recommendations. An embedded interactive map highlights key points of interest, making exploration visual and intuitive.

Built by Deividas Strole as part of his portfolio, LaWander demonstrates clean architecture, RESTful APIs, responsive UI design, and the power of combining AI with traditional full-stack technologies.
